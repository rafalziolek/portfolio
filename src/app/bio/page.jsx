            I&apos;m a designer and photographer living in Warsaw, Poland.
            Currently I&apos;m building design systems at Docplanner. Before
            transitioning to design systems I&apos;ve worked on
            Docplanner&apos;s SaaS software for doctors and clinics.

          Previously I&apos;ve worked in Absolvent to help build a place to find
          a job for fresh graduates, and at INVO where I was working on design
          solutions for small and medium clients.

            I work at the intersection of design and development. Wether
            it&apos;s a design tool or code I aim to strike a balance between
            usability and aesthetics, resulting in a product that is easy to
            use, but also playful and aesthetically pleasing.
