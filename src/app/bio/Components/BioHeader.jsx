          <Text>
            I'm a designer who loves getting into both the nitty-gritty details
            and the big picture.
            <br />
            <br /> Design for me is not just about making things look good; it's
            about crafting an experience that's intuitive, user-friendly, and
            above all, honest. I aim for transparency, ensuring that what's good
            for the business also benefits the person using it. <br /> <br />
            Beyond the world of UI/UX, I draw inspiration from various
            disciplines and arts, from photography to design as an art form. All
            these feed into a design process that's as versatile as it is
            focused.
