              Designer and photographer based in Warsaw, Poland. Currently, I am
              developing design systems at Docplanner. Prior to that, I worked
              on Docplanner's SaaS software for doctors and clinics.

              My approach
            </Text>
            <Text>
              I'm a designer who loves getting into both the nitty-gritty
              details and the big picture.
              <br />
              <br /> Design for me is not just about making things look good;
              it's about crafting an experience that's intuitive, user-friendly,
              and above all, honest. I aim for transparency, ensuring that
              what's good for the business also benefits the person using it.{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              Beyond the world of UI/UX, I draw inspiration from various
              disciplines and arts, from photography to design as an art form.
              All these feed into a design process that's as versatile as it is
              focused.

            <Text>
              Although I am first and foremost a designer, I do experiment with
              code to give my designs an extra layer of polish. <br /> <br />
              This hands-on approach helps me understand the possibilities and
              limitations, ensuring that my design ideas are not just visually
              appealing but also practically implementable.
