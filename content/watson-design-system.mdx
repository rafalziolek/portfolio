# Background

In 2022 I joined a design systems team at Docplanner. This team was responsible of maintaining our existing UI library we used in our products. During the 2022 together with the team we created a new design system tailored for our SaaS product called Watson.

## Initial state

Before Watson, Docplanner used the UI Kit library based on Bootstrap. While this approach was fast and cost-effective initially, it began to show its disadvantages as the company scaled its products and teams.

## The issues we faced

### Supporting two products

UI Kit library was used across two different products with different user groups and needs. SaaS for doctors, focused on efficiency and daily use, and marketplace, focused on discoverability and presenting information. Supporting these two products led to poor semantics of our directives, implementing components reusable only in one product

### Lack of control

Ui Kit library didnâ€™t provide custom design directives as we relied on opinionated third-party libraries. It led to a system that is dependent on a third-party and canâ€™t be easily adapted to the changes required by the product direction, thus creating a legacy inside it.

### Accessibility

Neither our foundations nor components were never created with accessibility in mind. The usage of third-party libraries was not helping the case as well. This generated debt regarding the WCAG conventions: lack of proper roles, aria-labels, keyboard navigation, or color contrast specs.

### Lack of documentation and shared language

Documentation was scattered in multiple places. We had separate documentation for developers and for designers. They presented information about components differently, with naming and UI inconsistencies across them. This generated confusion, and product teams wasted time finding the right solution or place to answer their doubts.

## New approach

After auditing an effort to fix the current solution, we realised itâ€™s better to start with a clean slate. As our previous library was started with marketplace in mind, we proposed creating an official team in charge of the new design system tailored for SaaS. Team would be responsible for providing tailored tools, and assisting our product teams for both Web and App environments, very much like Sherlock Holmesâ€™ best friend, [Dr. Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson).

## Our goals

We wanted to create a system that tackles many of our past issues at the roots. A custom solution tailored to our needs with unified language between design and development, accessibility engraved in its DNA, and clear extensive documentation.

## Laying out the foundations

We decided to start with the foundational design directives, such as spacing, typography, and colors. It allowed us to create solid foundations with strong emphasis on scalability and semantics.

### Typography

I was responsible of building our new typographic foundations. I started with an audit of our existing library and the product. My proposal included a simplified scale that would will well within our interface.

After defining the scale I worked on design tokens that would let us define semantic styles with clear usage.

### Unifying layouts

Another huge issue that our designers and developers struggled with were page layouts. We didnâ€™t have any guidelines on the existing layouts. Designers were designing them from scratch every time, which resulted in inconsistency in terms of spacings, widths and made it impossible to implement changes.

After auditing the product, I mapped all screens to find common features between the pages. I designed a proposal of a unified layout, with different variants that could cover all pages, and wrote an extensive documentation with best practices that could help designers decide what layout suits their needs best.

## First batch of components

After we tackled foundations and layouts, it was time to start working on individual components. Our SaaS mostly consists of two things: forms and tables. We decided to tackle forms first. We saw an opportunity to provide a good amount of components that are used across many screen and vastly improve accessibility. I was responsible of designing and writing documentation for components such as: radio button, checkbox, toggle switch, fieldset.
